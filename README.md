# COVIDVaxx
In this project, we look at how the administration of vaccines against COVID-19 took place in 2020 and 2021. We gain insight through key metrics such as how many people have received one dose vs two doses, what countries have the highest rates of vaccination and how GDP per capita plays a role.
